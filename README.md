## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to combine flex-box and grid in the same website, how to style the validation message of a form and how to effectively mak research in order to have optimum result.

### Continued development

I am still learning how to work with SVGs, so there isn't any in this project. I will come back to edit it when I am done practicing.
